This project provides Business Leaders an opportunity to apply their knowledge gained in Artifical Intelligence/Machine Learning field towards a practical, hands-on scenario and  formulate a cohesive AI strategy for the organization that is trying to make a transformational and paradigm shift in business.

* The project scenario: A CEO has launched an initiative to use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies in key, high-leverage areas of a business. Theyâ€™ve tasked the team with first developing ideas for many use cases for implementing ML and AI, then narrowing the use cases down to a shorter list to be implemented using a structured business approach for prioritizing the uses cases.

In each project step, the team will analyze each use case from one of the perspectives they've reviewed, then they prioritize and eliminate some of the use cases. At the end, the team create a final proposal on the short list of use cases to be implemented.

The project submission needs to include just one zip file, that includes each of the four documents you've worked on.

First, before you prepare your project for submission, make sure you assess your own work against the rubric for this project, and revise any pieces of your project that don't satisfy the "Meets Requirements" column of the rubric. Then you can go to the next page to submit your project.

Here are the steps to prepare your project submission:

If your two slides docs aren't in Powerpoint (.pptx) format, please convert both of them to that format. (Google Slides and Apple Keynote both offer options in the File menu for doing this conversion.)
If your spreadsheet doc isn't in Excel (.xlsx) format, please convert it to that format. (Google Sheets and Apple Numbers both offer options in the File menu for doing this conversion.)
Convert your Google Form to a PDF, using the Print menu.
Then zip each of these four docs up into one file that you'll submit. The zip doc should contain:

Your Slides Project Steps doc, in Powerpoint (.pptx) format
Your Sheets Project Steps doc, in Excel (.xlsx) format
Your Google survey form and results doc, in PDF format
Your Final Presentation slides doc, in Powerpoint (.pptx) format
Then you are ready to submit your project, using the blue button above. Good luck!
