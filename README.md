<h1> AI-ML Strategic Project (Paradigm Shift)
This project provides Business Leaders an opportunity to apply their knowledge gained in Artifical Intelligence/Machine Learning field towards a practical, hands-on scenario and  formulate a cohesive AI strategy for the organization that is trying to make a transformational and paradigm shift in business.

* The project scenario: A CEO has launched an initiative to use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies in key, high-leverage areas of a business. Theyâ€™ve tasked the team with first developing ideas for many use cases for implementing ML and AI, then narrowing the use cases down to a shorter list to be implemented using a structured business approach for prioritizing the uses cases.

In each project step, the team  analyzes each use case from one of the perspectives they've reviewed, then they prioritize and eliminate some of the use cases. At the end, the team create a final proposal on the short list of use cases to be implemented.
